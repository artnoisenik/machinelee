# About Machinelee

I've worked in higher education for the majority of my career, and I understand the frustrations of fast changing technology. Machinelee is a place for beginners and non-technical people to find clear and concise information. Our mission is to give everyone a supportive place to start their artificial intelligence exploration.

We all start somewhere. I'm still learning myself, but I hope to be a resource as AI grows.
