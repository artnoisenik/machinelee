# Important Figures in AI

We recognize there are many contributors to the field of AI. While this is not an exhaustive list, we believe this is an excellent start to explore the foundations of artificial intelligence.

1. **Alan Turing** - Often considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. His famous work includes the Turing Test and foundational concepts in computing.
   - Relevant Paper: "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950)

2. **John McCarthy** - Coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and was instrumental in the development of early AI. He developed the programming language LISP, which became crucial for AI research.
   - Relevant Website: [John McCarthy's Stanford Homepage](http://jmc.stanford.edu/)

3. **Marvin Minsky** - A pioneer in the field of AI, Minsky co-founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AI laboratory and made many contributions to AI, cognitive psychology, mathematics, computational linguistics, robotics, and optics.
   - Notable Work: "Perceptrons" (Book)

4. **Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon** - Known for their work in human cognitive psychology and AI, they created the first AI program, Logic Theorist.
   - Relevant Paper: "Human Problem Solving" (1972)

5. **Geoffrey Hinton** - A key figure in the development of deep learning and neural networks. His work on back-propagation is foundational in the field.
   - Relevant Paper: "Learning representations by back-propagating errors" (1986)

6. **Yann LeCun** - Made significant contributions to the field of deep learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are widely used in image recognition and processing tasks.
   - Relevant Paper: "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition" (1998)

7. **Andrew Ng** - Known for his work in machine learning and AI. He co-founded Google Brain and was a chief scientist at Baidu, making substantial contributions to the practical application of deep learning.
   - Relevant Course: [Coursera's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

8. **Demis Hassabis** - Co-founder of DeepMind, known for its AI program AlphaGo, which defeated a world champion Go player, marking a significant achievement in the field of AI.
   - Relevant Website: [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/)

9. **Fei-Fei Li** - Known for her work in AI and cognitive neuroscience, she was the leading scientist in the creation of ImageNet, a large visual database instrumental for advancements in deep learning.
   - Relevant Paper: "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge" (2015)

10. **Judea Pearl** - Made significant contributions to AI through his work in Bayesian networks and causality.
    - Relevant Book: "Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference" (2000)

Each of these individuals has significantly influenced the development of AI through their research, theories, and practical applications. Their work has paved the way for the current and future advancements in the field.
