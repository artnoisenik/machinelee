# AI Technologies

1. **Computer Vision**: Gives computers the ability to understand and interpret visual information from the world, such as identifying objects in images or videos. **Learn more at [NVIDIA's Computer Vision](https://developer.nvidia.com/computer-vision).**

2. **Robotics Process Automation (RPA)**: Automates repetitive, rule-based tasks by mimicking human actions. **Explore examples at [UiPath's RPA Solutions](https://www.uipath.com/rpa/robotic-process-automation).**

3. **Predictive Analytics**: Uses data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes. **Discover more at [SAS Predictive Analytics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/predictive-analytics.html).**

4. **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain, crucial for deep learning applications. **An overview is available at [IBM Cloud Learn Hub](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks).**

5. **Reinforcement Learning**: A type of machine learning where an algorithm learns to make decisions by performing actions and assessing the results. **Details can be found at [DeepMind's Reinforcement Learning](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning/).**

6. **Sentiment Analysis**: NLP technology used to determine the emotional tone behind words, useful in understanding opinions and feedback. **Learn about its applications at [MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/).**

7. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: AI models used to create new data that resembles the given training data, widely used in image, video, and voice generation. **Learn more with AI Summer's [GANs in computer vision - Introduction to generative learning](https://theaisummer.com/gan-computer-vision/).**

8. **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: AI-driven programs that simulate human conversation to provide customer support or information. **Discover more at [IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/watson/ai-assistant/).**

9. **Edge AI**: AI technologies that are processed locally on a hardware device, reducing the need for data to be sent to a cloud-based server. **Learn about its impact at [Intel's Edge AI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/edge-ai.html).**

10. **AI in Healthcare**: Technologies like AI-driven diagnostics, personalized medicine, and robotic surgery. **Insights can be found at [NVIDIA's AI in Healthcare](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/healthcare-life-sciences/).**
