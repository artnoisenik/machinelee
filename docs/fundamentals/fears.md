Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked a variety of fears and concerns among people across different fields and social contexts. Here's an overview of some common fears about AI and resources where you can learn more.

1. **Bias and Discrimination**: AI systems often reflect the biases of their creators, leading to concerns about fairness in areas like speech recognition, hiring practices, and more. This is particularly problematic when AI algorithms are used in critical sectors like healthcare, insurance, and banking. Addressing this fear requires human oversight and governance, as well as dedicated efforts to de-bias data sets and algorithms.

2. **Explainability and Transparency**: There's a fear related to the "black box" nature of AI, where even the creators of AI systems may not fully understand why certain decisions are made. This lack of transparency is especially concerning in regulated industries such as healthcare, where understanding the rationale behind decisions is crucial.

3. **Socioeconomic Inequality**: The advancement of AI could exacerbate existing socioeconomic disparities. For instance, automation driven by AI has led to wage declines in some blue-collar jobs, while white-collar jobs remain relatively unaffected. This raises concerns about the widening gap between different social classes and the unequal impact of AI technologies.

4. **Ethical Concerns and the Common Good**: Ethical considerations are at the forefront of AI discussions, with concerns about AI's potential to circulate misleading information and its impact on the common good. Prominent figures, including religious leaders, have warned against the unchecked development of AI without proper oversight.

5. **AI Phobia**: The portrayal of AI in popular media, negative experiences with AI technologies, and other mental disorders can lead to AI phobia. This fear can significantly impact a personâ€™s ability to engage with technology and function in modern society. Treatment for AI phobia often involves a combination of psychotherapy and medication.

6. **Fear of Conscious AI and Misuse by Immoral Actors**: Many people worry about AI becoming conscious and acting against human interests, or being used by immoral individuals for harmful purposes. This fear is often fueled by science fiction and media portrayals of AI.
